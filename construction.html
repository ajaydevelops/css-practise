        <img src="Bridge.jpg" alt="Bridge"/>
        <p>A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle, such as a body of water, valley, or road, without closing the way underneath. 
             It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross.
